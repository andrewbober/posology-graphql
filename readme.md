# Posology graphQL

The Belgian government exposes information about medicines, called SAM. 
It is the authentic source used by professionals (companies). The _data_ is exposed using _XML_ (xsd & xml's).

## What is this about

This project aims to expose the _XML_ data for the _web_, using GraphQL for its representation, so it can be used for posology calculations.

The _data structure_ has been simplified.

## Todo

* write better docs
* write tests
* create github repo for the frontend (spotify/backstage plugin)
